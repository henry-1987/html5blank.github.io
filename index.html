<p>Those of you who are still using Windows XP or Vista can be frustrating when you are looking for was to save Twitter videos, especially if your operating system is so old. You could use something like the 4kdownloade software,  which is great, but it's not very user-friendly, and there are a lot of minor annoyances that make working with it a bit of a pain. In this article, I'm going to list some of the top programs that you can use to save any video or gif from Twitter. Lets get started!</p>

You see, the 4kdownloader was created for modern computers with fast CPU's and graphic cards. If you were to try installing it on your computer, you'd have some issues because it's just not powerful enough. </p>


<p>Another thing that is a big annoyance with using the 4kdownloader to save Twitter videos is that it can be difficult to see where your files get saved. If you have several windows open, then it's even worse because you can't tell which program saved the file. When you have this problem, it's always worth getting a program that allows you to view your files in multiple places, such as in the Internet Explorer web browser. This is the best way when saving Twitter videos online, and you'll appreciate it when you're done working on the site.</p>

Start by pasting the Twitter video link into the text box on the homepage and hit enter. Wait for the video to process and click on the download button corresponding to the video that you want to save. It couldn't get much easier, could it?</p>


<p>If you know how to save Twitter videos online, then you've probably figured out that it is a lot easier to view them in the comfort of your own home.
